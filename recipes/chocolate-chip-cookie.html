        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
                <li>Optional: Flaky sea salt for sprinkling on top</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a
                baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking mat.</li>
                <li><strong>Toast the Butter:</strong> In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over
                medium heat. Continue cooking, swirling the pan occasionally, until the butter turns
                golden brown and smells nutty, about 5-7 minutes. Be careful not to burn it. Remove
                from heat and let it cool for a few minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl,
                combine the toasted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar. Stir until well
                combined and smooth. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.
                Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
                <li><strong>Combine Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the
                flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
                <li><strong>Mix the Dough:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet
                ingredients, mixing until just combined. Fold in the chocolate chips until evenly
                distributed throughout the dough.</li>
                <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared
                baking sheet, leaving some space between each cookie for spreading. If desired,
                gently press a few additional chocolate chips onto the tops of the cookies. Sprinkle
                lightly with flaky sea salt, if using.</li>
                <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for
                10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the centers are set. If you
                prefer chewier cookies, slightly underbake them.</li>
                <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the cookies
                cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to
                cool completely.</li>
                <li><strong>Enjoy:</strong> Once cooled, serve and enjoy your delicious Chocolate
                Chip Cookies! These cookies are best enjoyed fresh but can be stored in an airtight
                container at room temperature for up to 5 days.</li>
