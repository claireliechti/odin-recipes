            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul class="unordered-lists">
                <li>355g filtered warm water <em>(about 85 degrees F)</em></li>
                <li>7 g yeast <em>(active dry, instant, or quick rise- 2.25 teaspoons)</em></li>
                <li>520 g bread flour <em>if preferred, you may substitute up to 60 g of
                the bread flour for wheat and/or rye</em></li>
                <li>10 g salt <em>fine grain and non-iodized</em></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><u>Prepare the Dough:</u></li>
                    <ul class="unordered-lists">
                        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, and yeast. Stir well to
                        distribute the ingredients evenly.</li>
                        <li>Gradually pour in the lukewarm water while stirring with a wooden spoon or
                        your hands until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
                        <li>Once the dough comes together, cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a clean
                        kitchen towel and let it rest at room temperature for 12 to 18 hours. During
                        this time, the dough will ferment and rise.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><u>Shape the Dough:</u></li>
                    <ul class="unordered-lists">
                        <li>After the resting period, the dough should be noticeably puffy and bubbly.
                        Gently transfer it onto a lightly floured surface.</li>
                        <li>With lightly floured hands, fold the dough over itself a couple of times to
                        form a rough ball. Don't overwork the dough; it should remain somewhat loose and
                        rustic.</li>
                        <li>Place the dough seam side down on a piece of parchment paper and cover it
                        loosely with plastic wrap or a towel. Let it rest for another 1 to 2 hours until
                        it doubles in size.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><u>Preheat the Dutch Oven:</u></li>
                    <ul class="unordered-lists">
                        <li>About 30 minutes before the dough is ready, preheat your oven to 450°F
                        (230°C). Place a Dutch oven with its lid on inside the oven as it preheats.
                        This will allow the Dutch oven to get thoroughly heated.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><u>Bake the Bread:</u></li>
                    <ul class="unordered-lists">
                        <li>Once the dough has doubled in size and the oven and Dutch oven are
                        preheated, carefully remove the hot Dutch oven from the oven.</li>
                        <li>Using the parchment paper as a sling, carefully transfer the dough into the
                        hot Dutch oven. Be cautious as the Dutch oven and lid will be very hot.</li>
                        <li>Put the lid back on the Dutch oven and place it back into the oven. Bake
                        covered for 30 minutes.</li>
                        <li>After 30 minutes, remove the lid from the Dutch oven and continue baking for
                        an additional 10-15 minutes (until the bread develops a deep golden crust).</li>
                        <li>Once baked, carefully remove the bread from the Dutch oven and let it cool
                        on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes before slicing.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><u>Enjoy:</u></li>
                    <ul class="unordered-lists">
                        <li>Slice into your freshly baked Dutch oven artisan bread and savor the aroma,
                        flavor, and texture. Serve with your favorite spreads or enjoy it as is</li>
