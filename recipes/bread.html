        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>355g filtered warm water</strong> (about 85 degrees F)</li>
            <li><strong>7 g yeast</strong> (active dry, instant, or quick rise- 2.25 teaspoons)</li>
            <li><strong>520 g bread flour</strong> if preferred, you may substitute up to 60 g of
            the bread flour for wheat and/or rye</li>
            <li><strong>10 g salt</strong> fine grain and non-iodized</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, and yeast. Stir well to
                    distribute the ingredients evenly.</li>
                    <li>Gradually pour in the lukewarm water while stirring with a wooden spoon or
                    your hands until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
                    <li>Once the dough comes together, cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a clean
                    kitchen towel and let it rest at room temperature for 12 to 18 hours. During
                    this time, the dough will ferment and rise.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><strong>Shape the Dough:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>After the resting period, the dough should be noticeably puffy and bubbly.
                    Gently transfer it onto a lightly floured surface.</li>
                    <li>With lightly floured hands, fold the dough over itself a couple of times to
                    form a rough ball. Don't overwork the dough; it should remain somewhat loose and
                     rustic.</li>
                    <li>Place the dough seam side down on a piece of parchment paper and cover it
                    loosely with plastic wrap or a towel. Let it rest for another 1 to 2 hours until
                    it doubles in size.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><strong>Preheat the Dutch Oven:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>About 30 minutes before the dough is ready, preheat your oven to 450°F
                    (230°C). Place a Dutch oven with its lid on inside the oven as it preheats.
                    This will allow the Dutch oven to get thoroughly heated.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><strong>Bake the Bread:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once the dough has doubled in size and the oven and Dutch oven are
                    preheated, carefully remove the hot Dutch oven from the oven.</li>
                    <li>Using the parchment paper as a sling, carefully transfer the dough into the
                    hot Dutch oven. Be cautious as the Dutch oven and lid will be very hot.</li>
                    <li>Put the lid back on the Dutch oven and place it back into the oven. Bake
                    covered for 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>After 30 minutes, remove the lid from the Dutch oven and continue baking for
                     an additional 10-15 minutes (until the bread develops a deep golden crust).</li>
                    <li>Once baked, carefully remove the bread from the Dutch oven and let it cool
                    on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes before slicing.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><strong>Enjoy:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Slice into your freshly baked Dutch oven artisan bread and savor the aroma,
                    flavor, and texture. Serve with your favorite spreads or enjoy it as is</li>
                </ul>
        </ol>
